  <!-- === Slightly Increased Bikes/Minibikes/Motorcycles Spawns === -->

  <!--
    HOW THE SPAWNING WORKS:
    - The game spawns "clutter/decorations" the first time any player visits
      a chunk. And it also re-spawns all clutter inside whole POI boundaries
      whenever a POI becomes reset via a quest.
    - Clutter doesn't spawn until a player visits a chunk, which means that
      these changes will take effect on existing servers/saves too, but only
      for areas that no player has visited yet.
    - Area chunks are very small, only 16x16 squares. And the chunks don't
      generate until a player is very close to them and looking at them.
      Meaning that you don't have to worry that visiting a city somehow "marks
      that whole city as finished already". You have to be very close to
      a chunk to make the game generate that chunk!
    - Chunks are NOT all the same. Inner city roads have a VERY LOW chance of
      randomly generated clutter / vehicles. Meanwhile, HIGHWAYS between cities
      and the OUTER roads at the EDGES OF CITIES have a VERY HIGH chance
      of randomly generated clutter. The game's programming theory is basically
      "people fled from the cities, and their vehicles broke down or ran out of
      gasoline on the long highways between cities".
    - Therefore, if you want to find bikes, minibikes or motorcycles,
      the BEST place to look is at the roads at the OUTER EDGES of cities,
      and at the HIGHWAYS / ROADS between cities.
    - Asphalt roads have a higher chance of vehicle spawns than dirt/gravel
      roads, but both road types can contain vehicles.
    - Vehicles can also spawn randomly on the asphalt/gravel inside POIs,
      such as the driveways of POIs, or parking lots at big "parking lot"
      POIs, but the best chance to find minibikes and motorcycles is always
      at the roads outside cities!
    - There is NO BIOME BONUS! The forest is as good as any other biome
      for finding motorcycles! Many people wrongly believe that deserts have
      a higher chance of motorcycles. That isn't true! It might just feel
      that way because you're seeing a clearer view of the road when there's
      just a desert without any trees. But there's nothing in the game's
      code that adds more motorcycles to any specific biomes.
    - The best advice is to simply follow the large roads AWAY from the
      cities, and you'll find plenty of motorcycles, minibikes and bicycles!

    WARNING:
    - We're slightly raising the chances of bikes/minibikes/motorcycles
      on roads in the code below. DON'T MESS WITH THESE VALUES!
    - Every vehicle counts as an "entity", which takes up resources on
      the server. If you clutter the map with too many entities, you'll
      cause issues.
    - Furthermore, if you modify these values too much, you'll start to
      push away all other vehicle types from the roads, so that you barely
      see any cars or emergency vehicles spawning on the roads anymore.
    - That's why these tweaks are very conservative. There's ways to
      re-balance other vehicle to still be more common, but it isn't worth
      the effort and issues it would cause, since motorcycles are "easy"-ish
      to find if you simply look at LARGE ROADS away from/between cities!
    - It's also nice that motorcycles are pretty rare, since it's a fun
      little adventure to follow a large road to find one that you can
      repair and take over!
