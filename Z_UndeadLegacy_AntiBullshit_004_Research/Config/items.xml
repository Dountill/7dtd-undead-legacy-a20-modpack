  <!-- === Increased "Research Data" Availability (1 of 2) === -->
  <!-- See recipes.xml for the other settings. -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Carefully read ALL warnings.
    - Feel free to REDUCE these values closer to vanilla if you prefer grinding,
      but most people utterly hate the research grind, so most people will
      absolutely love these very balanced changes, which preserve the game's
      feeling of choice, while not feeling like such an utter torture anymore.
    - DON'T boost these values higher, since you'll get an exploitable "joke" game!

    WARNINGS:
    - SHORT SUMMARY: NEVER RAISE THIS VALUE ABOVE 100! VALID RANGE: 50-100!
    - Don't make this too high! You'll kill your long-term game balance and will
      get extremely bored when you have nothing to strive for and no more reason
      to hunt for research data outside your base anymore!
    - Yes, the Research Data system in Undead Legacy is painful, but it's designed
      for your own good! It gives you a goal and purpose in the game, such as
      having a specific recipe you want to unlock if you weren't lucky enough
      to get it via loot. It's an alternative way to get recipes you haven't
      found yet. It also promotes choice, such as "Do you want to learn this
      recipe, or would it be better to scrap it for research?".
    - You should NEVER go above 100, unless you want to completely "break the
      game", because the cheapest recipes in the game only cost 100 Research
      Data to craft, which means that you could craft those for 100, and then
      scrap them for more than they cost to craft! And yeah, they still cost
      some other materials too, but there are recipes such as "Cotton Seed"
      which only costs 100 Research, 10 Paper and 1 Cotton Seed to craft. There
      are plenty of other basic recipes with very low costs, including many that
      can be mass-produced via cheap resources like iron, so you should literally
      NEVER go higher than 100 in the scrap value below!
    - Putting it exactly at 100 is fine. That means that if the player creates
      the cheapest recipe for 100 Research Data + some other materials, and then
      scraps it, they'll get the exact amount of Research Data back (100) while
      losing all of their other crafting materials, which is a fair tradeoff.
    - Feel free to reduce it to an in-between value instead, such as 75 or 80.
    - Remember that UL has a lot of GRINDY goals, such as upgrading your various
      crafting stations, some of which cost 800 Research Data for the final
      upgrade for just one station. So it's recommended to get 100 data per
      scrapped recipe, which is the maximum balanced/safe value you can use.
    - SHORT SUMMARY AGAIN: NEVER RAISE THIS VALUE ABOVE 100! VALID RANGE: 50-100!
    - Another, semi-related warning: Your server's/game's "Loot Abundance" setting
      should always be at 100% or less when playing Undead Legacy. Otherwise the
      game's book containers often contain stacks of multiple IDENTICAL books,
      such as 2x Sniper Skill Book, 2x Bow Schematic, etc, which really makes
      the game trivial. That issue is caused by vanilla Undead Legacy and isn't
      related whatsoever to these tweaks, but it's mentioned here since it's very
      important to keep that setting at 100% to have UL's intended loot amounts!

  <!-- IMPORTANT: We use a selector below to only tweak the Research Data amount if it's less than 100, so that we're future-proof against potential higher values being added to UL in the future. -->
