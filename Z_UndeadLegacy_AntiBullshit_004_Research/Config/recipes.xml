    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Remember that our "OldBooks" tweak module also changes Old Books to be
      much more common in the world, and easier to craft. See that module's code
      for more settings related to Old Books.
    - Traders may rarely sell a stack of 1-50 books for $60 per book. Be careful
      and DON'T boost this recycling value too much, otherwise it will become
      way too easy to get research and you'll kill your own game enjoyment!
    - This recycling "Research Data" value MUST always be EQUAL OR LOWER than
      the crafting cost for Old Books (above). Otherwise you'll get an infinite
      research exploit, where you can craft books for less than their recycling.
      It's fine to make the crafting cost exactly the same as the recycling value,
      since it basically means "You put that much knowledge into the book, so
      of course you'll get the exact same amount of knowledge back from it
      since it contains exactly that much knowledge". It's balanced both from
      a gameplay perspective and a lore perspective.
    - For balance, the suggested recycling value range is 5-15 Data, which fully
      keeps the "worth" of Old Books (since they're an ingredient of many recipes),
      while still giving you a way to get a slight injection of extra research if
      you're willing to sacrifice some Old Books to get some research quickly.
    - However, a lot of recipes/schematics require Old Books as part of their
      crafting cost, usually requiring 10 Old Books, which means that recycling
      your Old Books is almost never a good idea. For that reason, we default to
      significantly raising the recycling value here, so that you get something
      useful when you decide to sacrifice Old Books to get some Research Data.
    - For reference, old versions of Undead Legacy used to give 5 research per
      recycled book, and even with "that much", people didn't think it was worth
      wasting the books by recycling them, so UL's new default of just "2" is
      terrible and definitely needs to be significantly increased.
    - The value "10" would be recommended, since it's very well balanced and
      still preserves the need to decide whether you'll recycle the Old Book
      for Research Data, or to keep the book itself for crafting things.
