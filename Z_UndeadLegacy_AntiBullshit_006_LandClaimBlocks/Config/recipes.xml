  <!-- === Land Claim Blocks: Easier Crafting === -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - By default, the vanilla (unmodded) game's LCBs are crafted in your own
      backpack for just "5x Small Stone". Very cheap!
    - Undead Legacy changed it to be an extremely expensive late-game item,
      and the author has said that the only reason was "to make it very hard
      for newbies to claim land on servers if they aren't gonna stick around".
    - However, the crafting cost is absolutely ridiculous. You need "25x Concrete
      Mix, 50x Iron Plating" in a heavily upgraded "Artisan's Table (Tier 2)".
    - If new players can't afford to make a claim block, then their containers
      are completely unprotected and anyone can go into their base and steal
      everything. That's why the LCB crafting cost needs to be affordable.
    - We instead change it to be craftable in the Carpenter's Table (the first
      crafting table that you make during the tutorial), and we set the cost to
      a reasonable "10 Wood, 10 Small Stones, 5 Scrap Iron". We still keep the
      one minute crafting timer, to keep the "serious" feeling of crafting
      a land claim block.
    - Keep in mind that Undead Legacy allows the players to lift their claims
      and place them somewhere else (without losing the LCB), so it's okay to
      have a slightly higher crafting cost than the unmodded vanilla game.
    - If you run a public "mega server", you may want to raise these tweaked
      costs. These new settings are meant for servers that aren't being flooded
      with temporary newbies every day. But they'll be fine for most publics
      too, considering that vanilla LCBs are extremely cheap and work fine
      for most servers, since players can only place a certain amount of claims,
      after which their oldest claims become invalid (destroyable in 1 hit).
    - Also keep in mind that Land Claim Blocks don't "scrap" into anything,
      and cannot be dismantled in the Recycling Station either, which means
      that you don't have to worry about people crafting these cheaply and
      then scrapping them for resources. They can't do that.
