  <!-- === Slightly Improved Vehicle Parts Availability (1 of 2) === -->
  <!-- See blocks.xml for the other settings. -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - We give "Pass N Gas" loot crates a VERY LOW chance of containing a bonus
      part for a vehicle that matches the player's own "Loot Stage" number.
    - "Vehicle Parts" here refers to the finished components of a vehicle, such
      as the bicycle or motorcycle frame, the handlebars, etc, which can be
      combined into a fully assembled vehicle from scratch. It DOESN'T refer
      to raw components that are used to repair broken vehicles in the world!
    - The "Loot Stage" scaling means that most players will ONLY be seeing Bicycle
      parts for a very long time, since the Loot Stage requirements for better
      vehicles are VERY high.
    - You can visit higher-tier POIs and harder biomes, since those will add
      very large bonuses to the Loot Stage. But even then, it's still very hard
      to reach the required "Loot Stages" where you'll see interesting vehicle
      parts, and it's equally difficult to actually find "Pass N Gas" loot
      crates when you actually get to those biomes and can survive the crazy
      zombies that live there.
    - The reason why advanced vehicle parts need an extremely high "Loot Stage"
      is mostly because Undead Legacy intentionally prefers that players have
      to craft from scratch or repair vehicles in the world instead of looting
      all finished parts themselves. So you'll mostly see basic parts. All
      advanced parts require such a high "Loot Stage" that you'll be "done"
      with the game by the time you see them in crates!
    - The primary goal with this change is actually that players in a multiplayer
      world will gradually be able to receive some occasional, spare vehicle
      parts, so that they can help out newer players on the server when it has
      been running for a while, when most of the world-repairable vehicles have
      already been destroyed by other players. It's very hard for new players
      to get any vehicles when a server has been running for a long time.
    - Game balance still remains, since the player will already have progressed
      past those vehicles long before they reach a "Loot Stage" that's high enough
      to loot advanced vehicles.
    - This vehicle parts tweak also goes hand in hand with the "EngineRebalance"
      tweak sub-module, which actually balances engine availability for smoother
      gameplay during the actual vehicle progression stages, where you research
      the maintenance schematics (via engines) and repair vehicles in the world.
    - To further balance the repairable vehicles in the world, we have to consider
      what components are required for repairs. We have already taken care of
      engines, but there are other, "special" parts that you'll need for repairs.
      Those include "Headlights" (which are easy to get by wrenching all kinds
      of vehicles, and in loot), "Lead Battery" and "Ball Bearings" (both of
      which can be looted or wrenched), and finally the specific type of "Wheel"
      that the vehicle requires. You'll also need various metal plates, etc,
      but those are all very easy to get or craft.
    - All types of vehicle wheels can be researched and crafted pretty easily,
      albeit at a heavy Research Data cost (200 for bicycles and 400-800 for
      all the vehicles after that). But since they are all craftable, they don't
      need any adjustment for their availability.
    - Players are still intentionally gated by having to research the wheels,
      and by having to research and learn all earlier/lesser vehicle schematics,
      otherwise they'd just be able to immediately loot the parts for a good
      vehicle and repair one! We ensure that they still can't skip progression.
    - The headlights, car batteries and ball bearings, however, can only be
      found via manual looting and wrenching, and they're annoying since they're
      common enough that you can easily get tons of them by destroying every car
      or truck you see (with a wrench), but for example the Headlight drop chance
      is only between 20-50% by default, which means that you have to destroy cars
      (20% usually) and trucks (50% usually) like locusts "for no good reason".
      It's also annoying since you can clearly see that the vehicles all have
      headlights and batteries, yet most of them won't contain any by default,
      which makes absolutely zero sense and is just tedious for no reaon.
    - Therefore, we'll also slightly boost the drop rate of headlights, batteries
      and ball bearings. Just a tiny bit so that it's less annoying. It was
      already easy as hell to get those parts in "vanilla Undead Legacy". It
      was just very grindy and repetitive, and meant that players destroyed all
      vehicles like locusts, which is totally pointless and just made the cities
      look even uglier.
