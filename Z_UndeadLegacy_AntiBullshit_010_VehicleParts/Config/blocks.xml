  <!-- === Slightly Improved Vehicle Parts Availability (2 of 2) === -->
  <!-- See loot.xml for the other settings and general usage/warnings. -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - For game balance purpose, we are raising the availability of vehicle
      repair parts that cannot be crafted. You shouldn't have to suffer from
      bad RNG chances for things that you can't craft! Vital components that
      are outside the player's own control (RNG) aren't fun game design.
      That's why these were slightly boosted.
    - We increase Headlights availability by roughly +15% from all vehicles.
      All cars already had a 20% chance, meaning that now they'll have a 35%
      chance instead. Trucks had a 45-50% chance, and now have a 60% chance.
      The result is less pressure to destroy every freaking vehicle you see.
    - We are also increasing "Lead Batteries" by roughly +10%, and Ball Bearings
      by roughly +10-15%, but for these items we ONLY raise sources that had the
      WORST drop chances, while leaving all the "good" sources' drop rates as-is.
    - The Ball Bearings are the most important, since you need 4x Ball Bearings
      to make 1x Cement Mixer, for example. You'll also need 3x per Blade Trap,
      and 1-4x per vehicle Wheel (depends on the type of vehicle). So the ball
      bearings are very important. Although you'll usually get 1-2 or 1-3 of
      them per object that drops ball bearings, which helps balance that out.
    - The Headlight requirements vary per vehicle, but you always need multiple,
      which is why that chance is also greatly increased.
    - The Lead Battery only really requires one per vehicle you're repairing,
      but they're used in other recipes too, which is why they get a small boost.
    - See the "loot.xml" file for more information about the reasons behind these
      balancing changes.
    - IMPORTANT: A few vehicles require the perk "Salvaging Operations" at "1/5"
      or higher to be able to drop Ball Bearings and Lead Batteries, and at "2/5"
      or higher to also be able to drop Headlights. Otherwise those things won't
      be part of CERTAIN vehicle loot tables. You should therefore always have
      salvaging operations at 2/5 or higher when you're wrenching anything. This
      is the same situation as engines, which also requires 2/5 or higher in many
      cases. You can read the code comments in the "EngineRebalance" tweak for
      more information about how the salvaging perk and action skills work.
