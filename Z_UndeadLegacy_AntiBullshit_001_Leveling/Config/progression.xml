  <!-- === Restore Vanilla's Leveling XP Requirements === -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Simply modify the two set-instructions below, if you want some other value,
      such as setting a value in-between vanilla 7 Days and UL's slow leveling.
    - By default, Undead Legacy requires almost 2x as much XP per player level,
      which is a significant grind. The tweak below restores vanilla 7 Days'
      leveling speed (XP progression).
    - We use the exact same values as vanilla 7 Days, which means "10000" XP to
      level, with a multiplier of "1.05". The values may look slightly different
      in-game, since the game applies its own additional logic to the result.
    - NOTE: If you're installing this tweak into an existing save, you'll still
      see your current, high XP requirement at your current level, but as soon
      as you reach the next level, your character's "next level XP requirement"
      will PERFECTLY correct itself down to what it should be at the next level!
