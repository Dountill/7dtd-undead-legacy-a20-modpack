  <!-- === Increased "Old Book" Availability (1 of 2) === -->
  <!-- See recipes.xml for the other settings. -->

  <!-- Range of how many "Old Books" you can find in a book container. -->
  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Remember that our "Research" tweak module also changes Old Books to be a
      pretty decent source for Research Data, so you SHOULDN'T boost the book
      amounts too much here!
    - The Old Books are required for a ton of workstation upgrades and creating
      various crafting recipes in the Research Station, among other things,
      so they're a massive pain point in Undead Legacy.
    - Old Books can exist within many places such as bookshelves, book piles,
      mailboxes, newspaper stands, trash piles, etc. But they share loot slots
      with a lot of other types of items, so the chance of actually seeing Old
      Books is low. Therefore, we're increasing the amount of books from the
      default of just 1x Old Book, to a random range of books (the recommendation
      is between "1-3 books"). So when they show up in a container, you have
      a good chance of finding a few of them. This makes a lot more lore sense,
      since only a madman would store 1 book in a whole freaking bookshelf. But
      more importantly, it means that you've got a better chance at smooth and
      fun game progression through Undead Legacy, without having to constantly
      curse at the terribly punishing RNG systems in that mod.
    - You're of course free to change this range to anything else, but try
      to keep it balanced so that you actually have to play the game and will
      feel happy when you find some books. If you make them too abundant, then
      you might as well just enable Creative Mode and spawn everything instead.
    - The book amount you find in-game isn't influenced by character stats,
      such as your lootstage, looting skill, or special skill books. The amount
      you set here is the same amount you'll find as a low level and at endgame.
    - Keep in mind that you can craft your own "Old Books" in the mid-game,
      via your workstations, and that we're also balancing that crafting cost
      to make that a viable way of getting books. You can also sometimes find
      stacks of Old Books in trader shops, although they're very rare.
