  <!-- Crafting cost to create an "Old Book" via "Paper". -->
  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Remember that our "Research" tweak module also changes Old Books to be a
      pretty decent source for Research Data, and it therefore also changes the
      "Research Data" cost of crafting more Old Books, to preserve the game's
      balance. See that module's code for more settings related to Old Books.
  -->
  <!-- WARNING: This cost reduction is important for game balance purposes. -->
