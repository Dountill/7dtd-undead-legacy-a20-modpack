    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - This "main folder" is just the location of the main "README.txt" file
      and various extra documentation and guides.
    - All of the actual tweaks exist within their own "sub-module" folders,
      for easy organization and editing.
    - Check the module folders if you want to read detailed code comments
      to learn more about every tweak, or if you want to adjust the settings
      of any of the tweaks.
    - You can delete individual tweak folders to remove specific tweaks,
      since every tweak is independent. However, the tweaks are all balanced
      to work together as a "complete package", so removing tweaks or only
      using specific tweaks is entirely up to your own discretion.
    - The "README.txt" in this project describes all of the included modules,
      and provides a general overview of everything. You should definitely
      read it before tweaking anything.
