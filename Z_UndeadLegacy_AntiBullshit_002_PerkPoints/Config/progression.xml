  <!-- === Perk Points Per Level === -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Simply tweak the set-instruction below if you want a different perk amount
      whenever you gain a level.
    - However, it's recommended to ONLY use the values 1 or 2. If you want even
      faster game progression than that, then you should boost the game's own "XP
      Multiplier" instead, to ensure that your actual player level rises faster,
      which in turn means that your "loot stage" rises, which will lead to finding
      better loot in boxes, thus giving you smooth loot and perk progression.
    - By default, perk progression in the game is extremely slow and tedious.
      Therefore, it's very popular to set it to 2 perks per level. That tweak
      has been included here, to make it an "all in one" tweak that doesn't
      require any other mods.
    - WARNING: Read the "Z_UndeadLegacy_AntiBullshit/GUIDE-Adding Perk Points
      to Existing Save.txt" document for more information if you're adding this
      tweak to an existing save (it applies to both servers and singleplayer).
