  <!-- === Less Sadistic Engine Loot Re-Balancing (2 of 2) === -->
  <!-- See loot.xml for the other settings and general usage/warnings. -->

  <!--
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    - You can set the salvaging drop probabilities for all engine types below.
    - These probabilitie have been increased for two reasons:
    - First of all, it was already VERY easy to get Car and Truck engines
      in vanilla Undead Legacy. It was just grindy, and meant having to destroy
      a bunch of working cars just to get an engine. That kind of bad game
      design just leads to players acting like locusts, destroying every car
      and truck they see in the cities in the vague hope that some will have
      engines, thus making the cities look like empty, sad and desolate
      landscapes since there are no more vehicles around. It also forever
      removes those vehicles from the loot pool (their lootable trunks would
      otherwise re-grow their loot over time). It's just really awful for the
      community on servers. There's no reason to have to destroy a ton of cars
      just to get engines, since it just leads to an empty-looking world,
      and is an artificial time-gate.
    - The second reason, is that it also makes absolutely ZERO LOGICAL SENSE
      that most cars would only contain broken engines, since most cars would
      obviously still contain working engines if this was real life!
    - The engine balancing has also been adjusted to make all important
      engines more available from Pass-N-Gas crates (see loot.xml), to further
      reduce the need to destroy the game's "beautiful apocalyptic cities".
    - Probabilities for the "Salvage" (wrenching) actions below are configured
      in the range from 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%). Every item is independently
      rolled, so the chances aren't affected by any of the other items in the
      harvest loot group when salvaging (unlike loot containers), so you
      don't need to worry about the probabilities of other items in the group.
    - The salvaging actions that use the "Destroy" event will only give those
      items when the block is destroyed, whereas the "Harvest" event calculates
      the block's contents at the moment it first takes any damage in the world,
      where it then calculates which items it has and how many of each (if
      there's "count" ranges for certain items). It then spreads those contents
      out across the entire wrenching/salvaging action, so it might contain "5
      Scrap Iron", and you might get those in three separate steps of "+1 +3 +1"
      for example. Speaking of which; the myth that "you can wrench an object
      too fast and skip over the loot" is totally wrong, since the contents
      are determined at the moment it first takes damage, and it's ALL given out
      to you throughout the wrenching regardless of how fast or slow you do it.
    - All of these changes also take effect for existing game saves / worlds,
      since the loot isn't determined until the player begins to harvest a block.
    - Also note that certain engines cannot be salvaged at all, and are instead
      random loot, such as the Aviation Engines (ulmResourceEngineV4), which you
      use for Gyrocopters, and the Buggy Engines (ulmResourceEngineV6), which are
      used for repairing Dune Runner "sand buggy" vehicles. Neither of those two
      engines are "required", since they aren't used for any recipes/research,
      but we'll make sure that they are still common in the "engines" loot group!
    - Some people decide to solve the "vanishing cars due to salvaging" problem
      by adding mods that make cars re-spawn like plants. In fact, Undead Legacy
      used to have that as a built-in feature. However, it was removed because
      respawning cars turns out to be super annoying. It means that cars will
      constantly respawn on the roads between cities, thus making the roads more
      annoying to navigate. Furthermore, there are plenty of "parking lot" POIs
      which will re-fill with cars anytime someone starts a quest there, so the
      availability of cars and trucks is always pretty good anyway.

    VERY IMPORTANT NOTES:

    - The basic rule of thumb in Undead Legacy is that you will only be able to
      salvage engines in vehicles that are either lootable (as a container) or
      are repairable, since most (or all) of the other vehicles don't have engines
      in their loot tables. Vehicles that are "dead" or stripped-down are empty
      and will usually only contain basic things like scrap metals and polymers.
    - VERY IMPORTANT: You need Salvage Operations 1/5 to get engines from CERTAIN
      vehicles, and 2/5 (or higher) to reach the "chance to get engine" tier for
      ALL vehicles that require Salvaging Operations to get engines. You should
      always have that perk at 2/5 or higher if you're destroying vehicles for parts!
    - The probability that you get an item is NOT affected WHATSOEVER by the
      Salvage perk or action skills or buff candies, so you CAN'T improve your
      loot CHANCES in-game whatsoever. They will only increase the AMOUNTS of
      the items that you found. For example, "10 Scrap Iron" might be "17" buffed.
    - However, the salvaging Action Skill at EXACTLY 100/100 (no less), will
      double the amount of engines you get when salvaging (so for example, instead
      of 1x, you'll get 2x engines WHEN there's a salvageable engine in the vehicle).
      But it takes a VERY long time to reach 100/100, so that bonus may as well
      not exist, since you'll be swimming in engines already by the time you
      reach that skill amount. This bonus doesn't just apply to engines, by the
      way. It just means that at 100/100, you'll double any items that you'd
      normally only find 1x of. You'll also get gradual improvements for items
      that have larger stack sizes along the way, so the action skill IS useful.
    - You should NEVER destroy any repairable motorcycles you find. They are
      still super rare, and they aren't even guaranteed to contain engines.
      Instead, you should find your Motorcycle Engines via Pass-N-Gas crates
      and random "garage" loot (such as Destroyed Generators, and in vehicle
      trunks). You should be REPAIRING the motorcycles you find, or leaving
      them there for other players. Read "biomes.xml" in the "BikeSpawns"
      sub-module for tips on the best locations for finding motorcycles!
