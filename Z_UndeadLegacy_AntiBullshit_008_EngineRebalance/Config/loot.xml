    SUMMARY OF NEW ENGINE LOOT GROUP CHANCES:

    - Motorcycle Engine: 2/10 (20%), good chance, so you won't have to wrench
      ANY repairable motorcycles you find in the world! Those should be REPAIRED
      instead. It should be FUN to find a repairable motorcycle, instead of feeling
      sadness and torture at having to wrench them all to progress in the vehicle
      schematic list, since motorcycles are insanely rare in Undead Legacy. Just
      continue visiting Pass-N-Gas stations and opening its loot crates until you
      naturally find a Motorcycle Engine, and then you'll be overjoyed when you
      can finally go and get that repairable motorcycle you've always wanted!

    - Compact Engine: 2.5/10 (25%), get those via Wrench at construction sites
      instead! We have massively boosted their drop rate from construction site
      machines. However, we keep a very good chance here too, just in case every
      construction site has already been taken apart by previous players and you
      fail to get any POI quests to reset those construction sites.

    - Car Engine: 4/10 (40%), get those via Wrench on cars instead! Chance
      is only kept high inside this engine group for "real-world logic purposes",
      since normal car engines are the most common engine type in the world,
      and they aren't worth much at traders either. Yes, they're meant to be
      as common as "candy", just like the real world. It's a freaking CAR engine,
      and you'll OBVIOUSLY find lots of those inside CAR REPAIR SHOPS!

    - Buggy Engine: 0.5/10 (5%), they are only used for Dune Runners, no recipes,
      so you'll have more than enough of these by the time you want to use one.
      They're kept rare to ensure that you most likely won't get one immediately,
      but will have one by the time you want one. You can also occasionally find
      them at traders, just like all other engines.

    - Aviation Engine: 0.5/10 (5%), only used for Gyrocopters, and by then you
      will have found an aviation engine thanks to our improved Pass-N-Gas crates.
      This is the exact same balancing situation as with the Buggy Engines above.

    - Truck Engine: 0.5/10 (5%), get those via Wrench on trucks instead. Most
      trucks have them, such as military/school/ambulance/utility trucks!

    Yes, it's nuts that we have to make engines so common now, but we're forced
    by Undead Legacy's terribly low spawn of motorcycles in the world itself.
    It's not our fault that Undead Legacy has a Motorcycle problem...

    NOTES REGARDING THIS LOOT GROUP AND HOW IT'S USED:

    The RARE "groupEngines" loot group is used by a lot of different containers,
    such as: Vehicle trunks (lootable vehicles, very rare), Destroyed generator
    banks (20% chance), "Pass-N-Gas" Sealed Shipping Crate (extremely low chance
    for engines by default, but we fix that below), and also as extremely rare
    loot in anything else that can contain "automotive (vehicle) parts" (via the
    "garage" loot container type).

    The point is that the "engines" loot group is extremely rare by default.
    Therefore, we fix that by giving Pass-N-Gas containers a very high chance
    of containing at least 1 random engine. It makes sense that mechanics would
    store engines in their supply crates. We implement the chance as a bonus
    item, separately from the normal chance to contain an engine, which means
    that you'll sometimes (very rarely) even see 2 engines in a Pass-N-Gas crate.

    There's no reason to hold back on engines for progression reasons, because
    you could already wrench a bunch of trucks in vanilla Undead Legacy and go
    directly to a "Truck Engine", the strongest engine/generator in the game
    on day 1 in the game. Likewise, it's very easy to get car engines by just
    wrenching various cars littered all over the map. Therefore, it doesn't
    matter that we're making engines as a whole better balanced. We had to do
    this to fix the terrible RNG bullshit, where you spend most of your time
    in Undead Legacy trying to find a freaking unicorn "Motorcycle Engine" just
    to be able to progress on your vehicles (since UL forces you to learn all
    vehicle schematics in their order, without being able to skip motorcycles),
    all while the map itself barely has any motorcycles at all. That's just
    awful game design and is pure, boring torture. Especially since most random
    motorcycles in the world are broken (won't drop engines), and even the
    repairable ones had a terrible drop rate for engines.

    The fact that repairable motorcycles are still so rare on the map also limits
    the impact of now having better access to motorcycle engines, since you'll
    still have to travel far and search the roads to find a nice, repairable MC.

    Furthermore, another reason for making engines more available is to ensure
    that the players don't have to move around the map like locusts that are
    scrapping every car in existence and making the maps look sad and desolate.
    It was already easy to get Car and Truck engines, which just required players
    to scrap an average of 4-5 cars or trucks. Increasing the engine availability
    just means that we're intentionally discouraging people's neurotic scrapping
    of every vehicle you see, and we're further fixing that by also boosting the
    chance of getting engines when scrapping vehicles (see "blocks.xml"), so that
    maps can retain their apocalyptic "beauty" instead of getting barren streets
    where everything has been scrapped by the players.

    Yes, you will have lots of leftover engines (especially Car Engines). That's
    totally intentional. They aren't worth much money, and you can just get rid
    of your extras. Thanks to this re-balancing of engine availability, you won't
    even have to scrap vehicles unless you're unable to find Pass-N-Gas crates.

    NOTE: We adjust EVERY engine type here, to re-balance the engine loot group
    as a whole. If other engine types are added to Undead Legacy in the future,
    they should be re-balanced below too. However, them adding other engine types
    is very unlikely, and the scaling of all balancing below has been made to
    use the same probability number scales as vanilla Undead Legacy itself,
    which means that any extra engines added later would automatically fit
    very well with our re-balanced probabilities, without further adjustments.

    WARNING: Manually tweaking ANY of the probabilities below will have a VERY
    big impact and will lower ALL other engines by same amount, so be careful!
    The numbers that were chosen in this loot re-balancing were the result of
    very careful consideration, taking into account vehicle availability, engine
    values at traders, realism, along with lots of actual loot-crate testing,
    since the Pass-N-Gas loot crates now frequently contain engines.

    You shouldn't blindly mess with any of these engine probabilities!
